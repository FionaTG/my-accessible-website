# My Accessible Website Plugins

I’m building a series of plugins to help you make accessible websites. The main reason websites aren’t very accessible is usually that developers don’t have the time to focus on it, so a library of plugins feels like the best way to help out.

My website can be found at: [myaccessible.website](http://myaccessible.website)

More information about all the plugins in the library, demos and how to use them can be found on the site too.

## [Skip Navigation](http://myaccessible.website/plugins/skip-navigation-plugin/)
When you’re navigating a website with the keyboard, it can be really tedious to have to tab through all the navigation links on every page. This plugin gives users the ability to skip straight to the main content of the site.
